### Step 3: Verify Setup

After running both scripts, you should see:

1. **Success messages** in the SQL editor output
2. **Admin user details** displayed in the query results
3. **Wallet information** showing the admin's financial setup

### Step 4: Test Admin Login

1. Start your application: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the login page
3. Use the admin credentials from your `.env` file:
   - **Email**: `adm01@promoG.com`
   - **Password**: `Menjo93458s`

## Database Schema Overview

The migration creates the following main tables:

### Core Tables
- **users** - User accounts with roles and subscription info
- **subscriptions** - Active subscription records
- **tasks** - Available tasks across different categories
- **user_tasks** - Task completion tracking
- **wallets** - User balance and earnings
- **transactions** - Financial transaction history
- **withdrawals** - Withdrawal requests
- **orders** - PayPal order records
- **payment_methods** - User payment preferences
- **notifications** - System notifications

### Key Features
- **Role-based access** (user/admin)
- **Subscription tiers** (member, silver, bronze, diamond, gold, vip)
- **Task categories** (main, social, surveys, testing, ai)
- **Approval workflows** for users and tasks
- **Orientation system** for new users
- **Financial tracking** with wallets and transactions

## Admin Capabilities

Once logged in as admin, you can:

- **Manage Users**: Approve/reject user registrations
- **Task Administration**: Create, update, and manage tasks
- **Financial Operations**: Process withdrawals and view transactions
- **System Monitoring**: View platform statistics and user activity
- **Content Management**: Manage notifications and system settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Column does not exist" errors**
   - Ensure you ran `migrate-database.sql` first
   - Check that all tables were created successfully

2. **"Permission denied" errors**
   - Verify your Supabase connection string is correct
   - Ensure you're using the service role key for admin operations

3. **Admin login fails**
   - Verify the admin user was created successfully
   - Check that the email/password match your `.env` file
   - Ensure the password was properly hashed with bcrypt

### Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify setup:

```sql
-- Check if all tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Verify admin user
SELECT id, name, email, role, approval_status 
FROM users 
WHERE role = 'admin';

-- Check admin wallet
SELECT u.name, w.available_balance, w.total_earnings
FROM users u
JOIN wallets w ON u.id = w.user_id
WHERE u.role = 'admin';
```

## Security Notes

- The admin password is hashed using bcrypt for security
- The system uses role-based access control
- All sensitive operations require admin privileges
- Database connections use SSL encryption

## Next Steps

After successful setup:

1. **Test the application** with admin login
2. **Create sample tasks** for different categories
3. **Set up PayPal integration** for subscriptions
4. **Configure email notifications** (SMTP settings)
5. **Deploy to production** when ready

For any issues, check the application logs and Supabase dashboard for detailed error messages.
